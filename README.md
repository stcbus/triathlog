Triathlog is a running/sport logging program for Windows.

The original code was written by Kevin Weil from 2002-2004 and announced on sites such as letsrun.com.

I enjoyed the program and had asked Kevin for the source (licensed GPL) years ago for preservation and
after stumbling onto it recently, I am putting it here in hopes of preserving apps and to keep the 
spirit of open source and cool programs alive.

Hopefully someone can find some use for it, or at least use it to learn and check out an older Windows
program from a historial perspective. The animations are definitely broken on modern Windows :)
