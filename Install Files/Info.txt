TriathLog 4.0
by Kevin Weil
September 2004

PLEASE READ THIS TO GET STARTED; IT'S SHORT, I PROMISE.


This program is free, with no strings attached, and will always be so.  I hope you like it. 

If you have used TriathLog before, first go to the file menu to convert your training log from the old version.

If this is your first time with TriathLog, select "Add User" on the dialog that pops up when the program opens, and follow the directions from there.

By the way:
1. For now, check www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~weil for updates.  Generally updates come during the summer, but smaller updates containing bug fixes are released year-round.  Hopefully in the future there will be a www.triathlog.com that is dedicated to the program, but I need some financial help (see Help | About in the menu) before that is possible.  If you want to be made aware of updates as they are released, drop me a line at weil@fas.harvard.edu and I'll add you to the mailing list.  This is not a high volume list -- I generally send out 4-5 emails a year over it -- so don't worry about it cluttering up your inbox.

2. Please send me any and all feedback (good, bad, bugs you find, anything) so I can continue to improve the program.
